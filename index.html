Hello, and welcome to my web page for Girls Who Code 

and Friends Club! Click on any of the tabs above to 

view the assignments I have done. More will be posted 

as time goes on. 

<br />
<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My name is Heather Fletcher. I enjoy art classes, and 

I joined this Club because I took a Web Design class 

at my high school and had a lot of fun during it. 

Apparently, Web Design has a lot to do with art and 

design, hence the whole Web "Design" thing. When the 

term ended, I still wanted to continue coding, and so 

now you are reading this on a webpage I have 

constructed. Cool right? :)

<h1>Things I've Been Up To</h1>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I went to Cereal Hack 4 with Kelly, Shantel, and 

Revekka a few weeks ago, and it was a blast! We 

presented our project and actually won a prize, which 

was an unexpected, but welcome, end to our weekend. 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Two weeks ago, I went to the Intel Workshop and found 

that I really like Project Management. It was good 

experience and I would recommend that anyone 

interested in coding of any kind go next year, and it 

is totally worth going, even if all they find out is 

how to change a tire. 
</p>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Now, I am currently trying to figure out how to do 

assignment 3, which involves animation and all sorts 

of other little goodies in javascript. :)
