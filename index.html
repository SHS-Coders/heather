     <h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
     <p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
       Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />
       All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
       And the mome raths outgrabe.<br />
       <br />
       "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br />
       The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br />
       Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br />
       The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br />
       <br />
       He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br />
       Long time the manxome foe he sought &mdash;<br />
       So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br />
       And stood awhile in thought.<br />
       <br />
       And as in uffish thought he stood,<br />
       The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br />
       Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br />
       And burbled as it came!<br />
       <br />
       One, two! One, two! and through and through<br />
       The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br />
       He left it dead, and with its head<br />
       He went galumphing back.<br />
       <br />
       "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br />
       Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br />
       O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"<br />
       He chortled in his joy.<br />
       <br />
       'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
       Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />
       All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
       And the mome raths outgrabe.<br /></p>
